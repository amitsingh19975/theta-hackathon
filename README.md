# Theta Hackathon

Since our college days, I have participated in competitions and even worked on projects that would require datasets, but it was tough to find them. One of the main reasons was that there was no incentive for people to collect them or make them public. On top of it, the sources were fragmented. There is no common place where you can search or download data.
Secondly, there is an inherent problem with the data sold; there is no accountability or way to track data, who got it from whom or who sold it to whom.
Lastly, there is no way to collaborate where one creates the data, and anyone who has write permission can update the dataset.

So, I made it my mission to solve these problems. As I was looking for the solution, I came across NFT. It partly solved the problem, but it was enough to inspire me to create a Shareable Token that could be shared among people. Furthermore, the EdgeStore allowed us to store a large amount of data on CDN that could do wonders when combined with Shareable Token.

OneStorage is a platform where anyone can create a dataset using GraphQL for writing schema. The schema is then parsed to get data types for checking constraints when a user pushes a row or rows, column names and data skeleton. Once the dataset is created, we use GraphQL language to mutate or query the dataset. After the dataset is populated with data, we can save it on the EdgeStore network. Afterwards, we can also share the dataset on the marketplace, where anyone can buy different permissions, such as read permission and read-write permission. If the user buys read authorisation, he cannot update the contract, and for read-write authorisation, they can also edit the contract. To make the data less heavy on the bandwidth, I have created a mini blockchain with a chunk of 1024 rows. Moreover, my app allows having a filesystem that closely emulates UNIX.

# How To Install

## Theta EdgeStore

Follow the instruction on the [here](https://docs.thetatoken.org/docs/theta-edge-store-setup) provided by the Theta Developers.

## Theta Thetanet

Follow the instruction on the [here](https://docs.thetatoken.org/docs/setup) provided by the Theta Developers. We would recommend installing Theta Localnet because 
- We have extensively tested it.
- You get free TFuels with around ten accounts, making it easier for running and testing.
## Web App (OneStorage)
1. Open a terminal
2. Clone the repo using `git clone` in your chosen directory.
3. `cd` into the cloned directory.
4. Run `npm install`. It will install all the dependencies.
5. Create firebase database account, and then copy the database config in `src/scripts/firebaseConfig.ts`. Furthermore, download or copy service account key in `src/plugin/serviceAccountKey.json`.
6. Before running on any new machine, run the `npm run resetDB` command. The reason is simple, I'm running firebase, which is global and visible to every machine, but EdgeStore and Theta blockchain are not. The filesystem that is saved on firebase is global, and the filesystem also has the contract address with the EdgeStore address that may exist on the other machine or not. These two have local addresses that may not be present on the other machine.
7. Finally, run the command `npm run dev` to run the web app.
8. Visit the localhost with port 3000, or `http://localhost:3000`.

# GraphQL

## How to write schema?
There is no need to learn a new language to write schema. We use the `GraphQL` schema language. Moreover, we use this schema to parse types and use it to check constraints or types.

## Mutations

There are three mutations available:
### 1. **[`addRow`]**

The function adds a row to the dataset.

**Example:**
```typescript
mutation {
    addRow(input: { /* ColumnName : Value, ... */})
}
```
**Returns** : `true` if row is added successfully.

### 2. **[`addRows`]**

The function adds multiple rows to the dataset.

**Example:**
```typescript
mutation {
    addRows(input: [
        { /* ColumnName : Value, ... */},
        {...},
        ...
    ])
}
```
**Returns** : `true` if rows are added successfully.

### 3. **[`commit`]**

The function commits the uncommitted chunk to the EdgeStore.

**Example:**
```typescript
mutation {
    commit
}
```
**Returns** : `true` if commit was successful.

## Query

There are three mutations available:
### 1. **[`show`]**

The function fetches the already in cached chunks and displays them as specified by the users.

**Example:**
```typescript
{
    show{ 
        /* ColumnName, ... */
    }
}
```
**Returns**: `Array` of `Objects` containing columns that the user has asked for.

### 2. **[`info`]**

The function gives the dataset info.

**`Info Schema`**
```typescript

type Fields {
    name: String!
    type: String!
    description: String!
}

type Info {
    description: String!
    path: String!
    name: String!
    size: Int!
    source: String!
    height: Int!
    fields: [Fields]
}
```

**Example:**
```typescript
{
    info{ 
        name,
        fields: {
            name,
            type
        }
    }
}
```

**Returns**: `Object` containing data that the user has asked for.

### 3. **[`loadChunk`]**

The function loads chunks in the given range.

**Prototype**
```typescript
type Query {
    loadChunk(start: Int, size: Int): /* Table */
}

```
**Example:**
```typescript
{
    loadChunk(start: 0, size: 3) {
        /* ColumnName, ... */
    } // [0, 0 + 3)
}
```
```typescript
{
    loadChunk(start: 3) {
        /* ColumnName, ... */
    } // [3, 3 + inf)
}
```
